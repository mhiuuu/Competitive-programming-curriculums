# Competitive-programming curriculums

**WARNING:**

This is simply the experience of a 16-year-old boy preparing for his job or just something he is genuinely obsessed with; it is not some sort of instruction or road map you have to follow. Please get in touch with me if you notice something incorrect. Happy programming!


# What you will need:

**1. Programming language:**
- You just need to be educated and trained in a programming language which allowed and you also only allowed to use built in library:

  **1.** Python 
  
  **2.** Java 
  
  **3.** C++
  
  **4.** Kotlin
 
- Please note that mastery here is not simply knowing a little bit of the simple syntax of that language but mastering the implementation of that language.
- I'll concentrate on C++ in this repository because it's also the most popular language for competitive programming competitions but it is okay if you use any other programming language because the idea of the algorithms will be the same.


**2. IDE**
- People frequently debate which IDE is the best for programming, but from what I've learned, you shouldn't give this issue too much thought. The IDE you feel most at ease with is the best one. However, in my opinion, I would suggest Vim and I have found a usefull Vim plugin for Codeforces [here](https://github.com/Igorjan94/codeforces.vim)

**3. Resources:**
- In this reposiory, I mostly used: 

- [VNOI](https://vnoi.info/wiki/Home) - a website for competitive programmin in vietnamese 
- [Geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) - place for many guide to algorithms and data structures 
- [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) - where you could learn a lot trust me! It has everything you need 
- [Cplusplus](https://cplusplus.com/) - documentation for C++ syntaxs
  
**4. Place to practice:**
  - [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com)
  - [Spoj](http://www.spoj.com)
  - [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains)
  - [Topcoder](https://www.topcoder.com)
  - [Codeforces](http://codeforces.com)
  - [Lightoj](http://www.lightoj.com)
  - [ACM-Timus](http://acm.timus.ru)
